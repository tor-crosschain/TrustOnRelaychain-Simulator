Overall Function Test

Multiple Parallel Chains

Multiple Gateways

Send a fixed number of transactions to each parallel chain, with a fixed cross-chain transaction ratio

Conclusion:
1. When the block size and block interval of two parallel chains are the same, and the cross-chain transaction ratio is 1.0, the final cross-chain transaction tps is at the same level (almost the same) as the tps of the parallel chains.
2. When the block capacity of two parallel chains is different, but the block interval is the same (so the tps is different), and the cross-chain transaction ratio is 1.0, the final cross-chain transaction tps is at the same level as the tps of the parallel chain with the smaller block capacity.
